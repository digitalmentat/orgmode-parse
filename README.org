  ~orgmode-parse~ provides a top-level parser and collection of
  attoparsec parser combinators for org-mode structured text.

** What's Finished
   We have built attoparsec parsers for parsing org-mode document
   structures and meta-data. Here is a list of all the syntax features
   that have a complete parsing implementation and not:

   - [X] Headings
     - [X] State keywords
     - [X] Priority indicator
     - [X] Title
     - [X] Status / progress indicator
     - [X] Tag list
   - [X] Property drawers
   - [X] State keyword changelogs
   - [X] Scheduled and deadline timestamps (timestamp, range,
     duration, periodicity)
     - [X] Active and inactive timestamps
   - [X] Clock timestamps
   - [ ] Markup
     - [ ] Emphasis
       - [ ] Bold
       - [ ] Italic
       - [ ] Strikethrough
       - [ ] Underline
       - [ ] Superscript
       - [ ] Subscript
       - [ ] Code / monospaced
     - [ ] Tables
     - [ ] Lists
       - [ ] Unordered lists
       - [ ] Numbered lists
       - [ ] Checkbox modified lists
     - [ ] Blocks (src / quote / example blocks)

   Org-mode markup is currently being worked on.

** What's Planned (outside of what's not finished)
   1. Modernizing this library and adding significantly more
      documentation to it
   2. Writing a sister library, ~orgmode-pretty~, providing a pretty
      printer implementation for an org-mode AST
   3. Pandoc integration

** Building
   There are a few ways to build this library if you're developing a
   patch:

   - ~stack build && stack test~, and
   - ~nix-build -A orgmode-parse release.nix~

   Generally, you should be using the ~stack build~ workflow but if
   you're on a NixOS system or have Nix installed and wish to test a
   Nix build (at the time of this writing, NixOS 16.09 has been used
   to build with) you can do so with the above ~nix-build~ invocation.
